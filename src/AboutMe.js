          Hello! My name is Victor Soltan, I am a web developer with over 4 years of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently freelancing. I love my job, I like to tinker more
          with code and complex technical tasks, I also try to ensure that the works that I create
          had an intuitive interface and beautiful design. I am glad to learn new things, which I do regularly improving my skills.
        </p>
